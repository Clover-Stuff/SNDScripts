## AutoHunt (formerly Hunt Log Doer)

Original by CacahuetesManu https://github.com/CacahuetesManu/SND/tree/main/Hunt%20Log%20Doer

Does one hunt log of your choice a lot more reliably.
It'll go to the inn after it's finished.

This script requires all files in this folder. MAKE SURE TO TELL SND WHERE THEY ARE (SND HELP --> OPTIONS --> LUA)
Make sure to set up your paths. Use the Lua path setting in the SND help config.

    C:\\Users\\Laszlo\\AppData\\Roaming\\XIVLauncher\\pluginConfigs\\SomethingNeedDoing

Like this: ![LuaPaths](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3e31a761-8e70-4d66-867a-b8bf762401d7)

    Change RSR to attack ALL enemies when solo, or previously engaged. If you use another rotation plugin and it's not trivial to get it working, let me know.

    Modify the settings in the script to match what you want.

    If possible, look for any uncompleted mobs in the hunt log while travelling.
    Skip dungeon mobs in other GC logs to IncompleteTargets function.
    Test all the mobs.
