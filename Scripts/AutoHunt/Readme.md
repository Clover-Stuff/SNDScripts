## AutoHunt (formerly Hunt Log Doer)

### IF YOU HAVE AN ISSUE, MAKE SURE YOU ARE ON SND TESTING v12.0.0.0 and both scripts are up to date! I, Friendly (ping me) &lt;AutoParty&gt;, will try to help with bugs but that will be my first question so don't be a dum-dum and do that first. Don't ping Wiggly for this script.

Original by CacahuetesManu https://github.com/CacahuetesManu/SND/tree/main/Hunt%20Log%20Doer

    An SND script to automate the hunt log for a given class/GC and rank. Goes to home/inn after.
    If doing GC log, it's recommended that you're lvl 50. There's an option to unlock SAM for iLvl 110 gear.
    Does dungeon mobs for GC logs, with an option to invite a helper character and leave duty after completing log.
    Does GC rankups, will try to exchange seals if that's preventing you from ranking up and complete all dungeons needed for rank 9 (for duck bones, oilcloth, etc.).
    No extra files needed, just check the configs/requirements in the script.
    
If you find a bug in the script and it's not in the list below, feel free to report it.

    ******************
    Class hunt logs aren't all tested.
    It spams "You need to finish the quest [insert quest name] to rank up more".
    If you wanna contribute, feel free, but I need to move on with my life.
    
You can help with mob positions without knowing how to code. If the script gets stuck, manually go the position you should go for this mob (try to have as many within range as possible).
Get coordinates from eg. Questionable plugin (see pic) and either make a PR here or send me the mob and coords on discord (Friendly (ping me) &lt;AutoParty&gt; on Punish).

# Misc
The old version requires all files in that folder. MAKE SURE TO TELL SND WHERE THEY ARE (SND HELP --> OPTIONS --> LUA)
Make sure to set up your paths. Use the Lua path setting in the SND help config.
