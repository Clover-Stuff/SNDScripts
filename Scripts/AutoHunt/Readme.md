## AutoHunt (formerly Hunt Log Doer)

Original by CacahuetesManu https://github.com/CacahuetesManu/SND/tree/main/Hunt%20Log%20Doer

Does one hunt log of your choice a lot more reliably.
It'll go to the inn after it's finished.

This script requires all files in this folder. MAKE SURE TO TELL SND WHERE THEY ARE (SND HELP --> OPTIONS --> LUA)
Make sure to set up your paths. Use the Lua path setting in the SND help config.

    C:\\Users\\Username\\AppData\\Roaming\\XIVLauncher\\pluginConfigs\\SomethingNeedDoing

Like this: ![LuaPaths](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3e31a761-8e70-4d66-867a-b8bf762401d7)

    Change RSR to attack ALL enemies when solo, or previously engaged. If you use another rotation plugin and it's not trivial to get it working, let me know.

    Modify the settings in the script to match what you want.
    
If you find a bug in the script and it's not in the list below, before you report it, please make sure to redownload all the files needed for this script again.

    If possible, look for any uncompleted mobs in the hunt log while travelling.
    Skip dungeon mobs in other GC logs to IncompleteTargets function.
    Test all the mobs.
You can help with this. If the script gets stuck, manually go the position you should go for this mob (try to have as many within range as possible).
    Get coordinates from eg. Questionable plugin (see pic) and either make a PR here or send me the mob and coords on discord (Friendly on Punish). ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ee348812-3d1f-4581-b731-07ec9093c954)
