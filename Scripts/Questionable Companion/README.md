## This script is mostly working. However, you need to have the old SND and old version of vac_functions for it (tutorial in SNDScripts/Tutorials).

### Make sure you have `vac_functions.lua`, `vac_lists.lua` in your snd config folder.
These can be found in the top directory of this repo. 

Place them in your Something Need Doing config directory, which will be located at `%appdata%\XIVLauncher\pluginConfigs\SomethingNeedDoing\`
