Hey all :AhriWave: , I will show you how you can contribute to this folder via a pr (pull request).

First things first, you need to make a github account, then log in.
Then, go to https://github.com/WigglyMuffin/SNDScripts and click fork

Done! if you need to change it, you can find this later in the target repo under pull requests (top). You can adjust it, close it, check up on it in case the maintainer left a comment, etc.
