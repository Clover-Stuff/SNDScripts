Every single line of code written by anyone is shit, just a matter of how much so. Even legendary code turns to shit with time. Don't doubt yourself, if it works, it works. If it doesn't work, debug it. If you can't debug it, ask for help. If you can't ask for help, take a break and try again later.  
Take it easy. This is the kid's pool, not NASA.
That being said, try to improve. Add error handling, write clear comments and expand your toolset. Future you and everyone else will thank you. Good luck.
