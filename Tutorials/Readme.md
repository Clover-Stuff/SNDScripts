Every single line of code written by anyone is shit, just a matter of how much so. Don't doubt yourself, if it works, it works. If it doesn't work, debug it. If you can't debug it, ask for help. If you can't ask for help, take a break and try again later.
This is the kid's pool not NASA, take it easy.
